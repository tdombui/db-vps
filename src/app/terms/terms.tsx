            uses secure processing called SSL Encryption Technology (using
            Stripe Payments), which is the industry standard. SSL(Secure Sockets
            Layer) is a protocol developed for the transmission of private
            information over the internet. SSL uses a private key to encrypt
            your data, including your credit card information, so that it cannot
            be read while being transferred over the internet. With Stripe, you
            can shop this Site with total peace-of-mind.
